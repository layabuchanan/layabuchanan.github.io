### About Me
I am current student at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health working towards a Master of Public Health graduate in Epidemiology. At the Mailman School, I focus on molecular epidemiology and environmental health. Most recently, I have worked as an intern with the Global Psychiatric Epidemiology group. I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I have learned at Mailman to a career in public health. 


#### Bonus: Dashboard

Here is a link to a [dashboard](dashboard.html) featuring three plots exploring the maximum temperature variable in the NY NOAA dataset for the years 1997 to 2001. The plots in this dashboard display (maximum temperature is always displayed in degrees Celcius:

*   the overall distribution of the maximum temperature per day for each station

*   the distribution of snowfall in cm by the maximum temperature for the day for each station included in the dataset

*    boxplots for average temperatures by month
